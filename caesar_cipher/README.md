## Caesar Cipher

### Summary

The Caesar Cipher program implements the following features:
 - Graphical Interface
 - Encryption and decryption
 - User choice of phrase and key
 - Robust design to minimalise errors and improve user experience
 - Brute-force attack system with a dictionary lookup feature for possible matches
 - Saving of encryption and decryption results in a text file, including previous messages.

### Requirements and Running

#### ONLINE ####
To run this program online, use the following link to the project Repl:

```
https://replit.com/@pmkhambhaita/Caesar-Cipher
```

#### OFFLINE ####

To run this program offline, the following are required:
 - Python 3.x
 - Tkinter library
 - ~ 8MB free space

In a terminal, enter the directory of the program and type:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Usage

A GUI window will open upon running. There are 3 main elements to the GUI - the entry box where a message is entered, and the two buttons for encrypting and decrypting.
#### To encrypt:
 - Enter the message you wish to encrypt in the text box
 - Press the "Encrypt" button
 - A pop-up window will appear, enter the key you wish to use.
 - Confirm the encryption by typing "Confirm" (not case-sensitive). Any other character will abort the encryption
 - A message will appear stating the encrypted message, after which a popup to save the encrypted message appears.

#### To decrypt:
 - Enter the message you wish to decrypt into the text box
 - Press the decrypt button
 - A pop-up window will appear, enter the key used on the message.
 - A message will appear stating the decrypted message, after which a popup to save the decrypted message appears.

#### To brute-force:
 - Enter the message you wish to decrypt into the text box
 - Press the decrypt button
 - A pop-up window will appear prompting for the key used. Enter either zero or any value outside the range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
 - Another pop-up window will appear to confirm the bruteforce. Type "Confirm" (not case-sensitive) to proceed. Any other character will abort the attack.
 - The brute-force will then take place. Based on the arrangement of letters, various popups will appear as to possible keys. These will also be highlighted in the saved text file with an arrow. eg. ----> Key 1: Test.
 - The brute_force.txt file is saved and a pop-up confirming its success will appear.

### About the caesar_cipher function

The caesar_cipher itself is much shorter than expected, due to the use of an ASCII system rather than an alphanumeric system. I utilised the fact that letters are represented by ascending ASCII numbers (lowercase a being 001 and so on). By using this, you can simply add the key to the ASCII representation of each letter and convert back into alphanumeric characters. This allows for a much shorter program, as well as more versatility surrounding the characters on which the cipher is applied, as it is a short matter to exclude all non-alpha characters, which enables for much longer strings to be used. 


Any questions/bugs, please raise an issue!
